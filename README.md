# IDetector
Python Version- 3.6.8
This is a game similar to flappy bird, but uses eye gestures as input instead of using traditional keyboard inputs

This program uses python's built in libraries such as openCV, and dlib to track the motion of the eye.
Using openCV, we are able to capture the live video from the webcam.
dlib has very useful face detection functions built in to it, which our program implements
NOTE: dlib, does not work with versions of python above 3.6.8.
